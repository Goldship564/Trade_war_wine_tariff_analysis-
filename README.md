**Overview**

This repository contains an advanced economic analysis of how a threatened 200% U.S. tariff on EU wine and Champagne, announced March 13, 2025, could affect prices in Hong Kong as of March 14, 2025. The study contrasts mid-range wines ($20-$50) and luxury wines (over $100) using sophisticated mathematical models and economic theory, including Ramsey optimization, differential equations, and Nash bargaining.
Key Findings
Mid-Range Wines: Prices drop ~27% ($40 to $29.30) due to dynamic oversupply (400,000 extra bottles).
Luxury Wines: Prices rise 5% ($200 to $210) as prestige demand and bargaining offset a 20,000-bottle influx.
Implications: Hong Kong gains mid-range affordability, EU producers lose revenue, and trade tensions risk escalation.



**Methodology**

Mid-Range: Ramsey intertemporal utility maximization and differential supply adjustment.
Luxury: Veblen goods demand with Nash bargaining between EU producers and Hong Kong buyers.
Data: Assumes 80M mid-range and 10M luxury bottles displaced globally, with Hong Kong absorbing 0.5% and 0.2%.
